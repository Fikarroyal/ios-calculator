# iOS Calculator

A minimal yet fully functional clone of the iPhone calculator, built with HTML 5, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, no build tools, just open index.html and start crunching numbers.

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentages, and sign toggle (±)
- AC (all‑clear) and backspace support
- Inline expression display with previous operand and operator
- Keyboard shortcuts for all numbers, operators, Enter (=), Backspace, and Esc (AC)
- Responsive layout; fits 320 px mobile screens up to desktop
- Smooth button press animations and hover transitions

## Extending the App

- History Tape – Push every result to an array and render a scrollable log.
- Scientific Mode – Enlarge the grid and add functions like sin, cos, log, and exponent.
